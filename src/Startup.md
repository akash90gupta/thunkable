How to get started 
 -- Get into the root folder (a.k.a thunkable)
 -- run npm start
 -- the application will automatically load on the browser as long as you have node installed.
 -- For more information, read the README.md file about how the react app has been bootstrapped with the create app React incubator as this can do live reloads and you don't need webpack or grunt

 --
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-app
cd my-app/
npm start
